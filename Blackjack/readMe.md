This is a program that allows you to play the most basic version of Blackjack.\
\
The Game Tester class referees the game. It determines who wins or loses. It\'92s set up as an infinite loop so that while the user keeps playing, it continues to referee the game. It ends when the user decides to quit.\
\
The Game class defines most of the rules. The play() method would run only when the user has enough balance. It resets the win/lose/tie conditions, the total points, the player\'92s hand and the deal\'92er hand every time it is played. The playAgain class asks whether the user wants to keep playing, and calls the play() method if the user wants to keep playing. \
\
The Card class defines each card\'92s properties.\
\
The Deck class creates a deck of cards.\
\
The Player class defines the player\'92s hand and a few methods for facilitating the Game class.\
\
The Dealer class defines the player\'92s hand and a few methods for facilitating the Game class.\
\
Used Eclipse for editing and compiling the code.\

 Have a nice day!\
